  -----> ArrayList allow concurrent
  operations means two guys can do
  two different operation on arraylist

  A----> Add elemets (vector is lock)
  B---->Try to access ---->vector(Exception Locked)

=========>Reason is that Arraylist is
non synchronous and Vector is Syn
means one operation at a time.
